    Basaveshwar Engineering College (BEC), Bagalkot is undergoing unswerving growth since 1963. It started as a private institute with only three Engineering programs viz. Civil, Mechanical & Electrical Engineering and came into Government grant in-aid code from 1968. Today, the institute offers 9 undergraduate and 8 post graduate programmes with 10 departments recognized as R&D centers by VTU, Belagavi. It is a matter of pride for BEC to be placed in the rank band of 201-250 at all India level for the year 2019-20 by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) of MHRD, New Delhi.

The growth of institution can be pigeon-holed into three phases as it has undergone enormous change from 1963 till date. The main focus during phase-I (1963 to 1983) was consolidation and strengthening of the basic infrastructure facilities to achieve academic excellence. During phase-II (1983 to 2003) of the institutional growth the emphasis was on expansion of UG programmes, introduction of PG programmes, Upgradation of faculty qualifications and initiation of research activities. By 2003 the college started 7 additional UG and 4 new PG programmes, including MCA, thus enhancing the studentsâ€™ strength from 300 to 2300 and faculty strength from 20 to 140. The stabilization of institutional growth in phase-I and phase-II created a tarmac for takeoff into phase-III in 2003. The selection of College under Technical Education Quality Improvement Program (TEQIP-I, 2004-2009) of MHRD, New Delhi was onset of new era in the history of College. The TEQIP-I grant of Rs.14.16 crores was effectively utilized for scaling up UG programs and College was granted academic autonomy from UGC, New Delhi in 2007. The performance of College in TEQIP-I led to the selection under TEQIP-II on merit basis. A grant of Rs. 12.50 crores was sanctioned for scaling up PG programs and R&D activities in 2011. During this phase the programs were also accredited by NBA, New Delhi. Based on its performance during TEQIP-II the College was recognized as best performing institute by National Project Implementation Unit (NPIU) and granted an additional fund of 5.00 Crores. Further, in Phase-III of TEQIP it received a grant of 7.00 crores to strengthen R&D activities and has the pride of being selected to mentor Rajakiya Engineering College, Bijnor, UP. Once again the college was recognized as one of the best performing colleges and received an additional grant of Rs. 1.47 crores. The phenomenal growth during the three phases abetted the college in securing NIRF ranking and also recognition at Global level.
